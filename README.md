# DuckHuntGame
A game built in collaboration with another student that copied the basic behavior of the game Duck Hunt.
The controller was an analog joystick that was connected to a Raspberry-Pi Running the phython script in this repo. All of the .vhd was sythesized in Quartus Prime and run on a Terasic DE-10 Dev board. The project took ~3 hours to compile when including the arrays that defined the background and duck images for the VGA driver.
